Maybe make the user pick a picture or symbol as an easy identifier to quickly find a template.,49.89,7380,0,,,"Did not notice a difference between the two templates..., Keyword- and alphabetical sorting are definately necessary when we have many templates, No alphabetical sorting, should not throw you back to template screen but to landing page, whole edit screen should fit on one page, green checkmark is not intuitive because it is on the top. The control flow goes from top to bottom, but at the end you have to go all the way to the top again, icons on template screen are confusing at first because user thinks that he can edit these values. Is this even necessary information to display?"

Didn't realise that All Day - All Day was for selecting time if All Day was not set.
Open Events are not clear because ""Open Events"" can be interpreted as ""Open a New Event"".
Liked Variant A more because it gave a better overview.
The overall system is not bad, but having many templates definitely requires sorting/filtering."

Debriefing: They found it easy to use, but were confused because the checkmark seemed that changes are already registered (does not look like confirm). They found it fast, but wished for a clearer differentiation between edit and use."

Debriefing: They like the Idea of templates, but were confused with empty template. They wish for a way to check the work after editing a template."

- The user would rather use the ""+"" button rather than open the drawer and select template.
- The user would like to use ""Save"" button rather than a tick to save the template (that is, because the user is a IPhone user and there is a ""Done"" button). "
11/30/2023 14:20:11,8,42.5,334,0,Had to restart once because the zoo template was not displaying,,48.7,1637,0,No bugs,,Somehow it was more intuitive for this tester to access the preset templates via the navbar. The plus button was not used. This might be due to the fact that the tester does not use a digital calendar like google calendar and hence is not too familiar with the plus button flow.
11/30/2023 14:28:05,9,65,254,1,,,55.3,832,0,,,The tester was a bit confused after both subtasks concerning whether the changes were actually applied to the template or the new event was actually created. The tester would have liked a visual confirmation as to the success of his actions. I guess a snackbar or success screen would have done the job.
