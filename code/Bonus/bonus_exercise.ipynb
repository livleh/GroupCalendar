    "\n",
    "Integer programming is an exact method for solving optimization problems. \n",
    "- guarantees to find the optimal solution and gives bounds on the goodnness of intermediate solutions\n",
    "- requires mathematical formulation of the problem \n",
    "- fast and easy to implement with Gurobi\n",
    "- classical \n",
    "\n",
    "The mathematical formulation is critical and key to using standard solvers efficiently. We have seen one class of classical problems - assignment problems. Many design problems in HCI can be cast as assignment problems, but there are also other problem classes in combinatorial optimization which can be useful to know about when trying to abstract a design problem. See for example <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorial_optimization#Specific_problems\">here</a>.\n",
    "\n",
    "For computationally complex optimization problems (e.g. QAPs), it can be useful to work with optimization experts, e.g. from your university. They often know a lot of \"tricks\" and might be able to reformulate your problem or know how to exploit its structure to solve it faster. "
